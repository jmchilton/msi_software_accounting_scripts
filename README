This project contains a script for parsing collectl logs collected on
MSI machines and producing SQL statements for loading the relevant
data into the MSI software accounting database.


If the collectl parse script is configured to dump straight to a
postgres database, the psycopg2 python module must be installed. This
can be installed from the Python package index via:

easy_install psycopg2

or obtained from the operating system's package manager.
